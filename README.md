### Hi there! I'm Eric ðŸ‘‹

I am a freelance web developer.  
I'm looking to expand my skill set and tackle new challenges through obtaining employment with a team of skilled developers.  
I'm a quick study, and a meticulous problem solver.
And I firmly believe in contributing to a positive workplace culture.
